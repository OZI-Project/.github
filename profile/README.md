## OZI Project

This organization is the official working group for the development of OZI pure python packaging tools for the Meson build system.

Currently this project is in a Pre-alpha state.

## Motivation

### Commandline Toolchain

* Supply-chain as sourcecode; all packaging-related metadata in the pyproject.toml.
  * [x] NO setup.cfg
  * [x] NO setup.py

### Continuous Integration and Deployment

* Dependencies for the packaging process should be managed like actual source dependencies.
* A publishing tool should provide templated workflows:
  * [x] checkpoint - run dist, test, and lint checks; procure signed test log artifacts
  * [x] release - build [sigstore](https://sigstore.dev/) signed wheel and source releases
  * [x] generate-provenance - [SLSA v1.0 - Level 3](https://slsa.dev/spec/v1.0/levels#build-l3) provenance
  * [x] publish - publish releases to [PyPI](https://pypi.org/); and mirror releases, signature bundles, and provenance in a tagged release

## Goals

### Commandline Toolchain

* ðŸš§ Initialize and output pure Python package sources.
* ðŸš§ Track skipped coverage and quality assurance checks.

### Continuous Integration and Deployment

* ðŸš§ Be as CI/CD-provisioner agnostic as possible - GitHub is the only one supported for the time being, GitLab is a Work in Progress.
